moskotron
=========

A unique analog audio synthesizer. Built with and for Alex Moskos - aka Drainolith. 

Audio is generated by a Korg Monotron, which is extended by wiring in two new boards: 
an ADSR enveloped waveshaper and a 5-key tunable touch keyboard.
The keyboard can be tuned to any scale - conventional, microtonal or weird.

The entire synthesizer was encased in a book - for effect.

See http://madanworb.com/blog/2012/08/15/moskotron/ for video of Alex trying it out for the first time.

Schematics and burnable pcb layouts are available in the documentation folder.
